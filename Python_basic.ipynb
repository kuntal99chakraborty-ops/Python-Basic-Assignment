        "1) What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a popular high level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readibility, making it a versatile tool for various tasks including web development, data science, AI, automation, and software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples why Python is popular\n",
        "\n",
        "*Python is an easy to learn progrmamming language making it a good choice new programmers and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "*python is used in diverse fields which includes web development, automation,software development etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Python has a vast collection of reusable code (libraries and frameworks like Django) that accelerate development and prevent reinventing the wheel.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Python has a large, supportive and an active community which supports Python's growth, providing resources, support, and solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Python interpreter is a program that directly executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages, which are entirely translated into machine code before execution, Python is an interpreted language. This means the interpreter reads, analyzes, and executes the code line by line at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words with special meanings and functionalities within the language. These words are an integral part of Python's syntax and structure, dictating how the interpreter understands and executes code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keywords cannot be used as variable names, as they have a special, predefined meaning to the compiler or interpreter and using a keyword variable names will cause a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, mutability refers to whether an object's state or value can be changed after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Few examples of mutable objects in python are\n",
        "Lists, Sets\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are mutable because their class implementation includes operations ike append that allow for adding, removing, and changing elements after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Whereas, tuples are immutable because their implementation does not provide such mutator methods, meaning they are fixed and cannot be changed once defined. This fundamental difference in their designed interfaces determines their mutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- “==” operators\n",
        "\n",
        "* It compares the values of two objects.\n",
        "* It evaluates whether the content or data held by two objects is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "- “is” operators\n",
        "\n",
        "* Compares the identity of two objects.\n",
        "* It checks whether two variables or references point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False). They return a Boolean value as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "* There are 3 logical operators in Python which are:\n",
        "operator (Logical AND):\n",
        "operator (Logical OR):\n",
        "operator (Logical NOT):\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Type casting, also known as type conversion. Type casting is the process of converting a variable's data type into another data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Difference between implicit and explicit type casting are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit type casting\n",
        "* It is automatic as the coversion is performed automatically by the compiler or interpreter without programmer intervention.\n",
        "* It occurs when a value from a smaller data type is converted to a larger data type.\n",
        "* This process is safe as the larger type can hold the entire value of the smaller type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit type casting\n",
        "*  It is manual and the programmer must explicitly write the code to perform the conversion.\n",
        "* It involves converting a value from a larger data type to a smaller one.\n",
        "* This can lead to data loss or truncation because the smaller type may not be able to accommodate the full range of values from the larger type.\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to enable decision-making within a program, allowing different blocks of code to be executed based on whether specific conditions are true or false. This control over the program's flow is fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The elif statement, which stands for \"else if,\" is used to check multiple conditions sequentially in a conditional statement. It always follows an initial if statement and can be followed by any number of other elif statements, with an optional else statement at the very end.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "*  for loops\n",
        "- for loop is used for a known, fixed number of iterations.\n",
        "- for loops have a concise structure for initialization, condition, and increment within the loop declaration, making them ideal for iterating over collections or a predetermined range.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  while loops\n",
        "\n",
        "- while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
        "- while loops check a condition before each iteration and require the loop body to manage any necessary updates to keep the condition from becoming permanently true, which could lead to an infinite loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is unknown or unpredictable in advance, such as waiting for user input until a valid entry is provided, reading data from a file until the end is reached, or streaming data from a database until a specific condition is met. In these cases, a for loop is less ideal because it typically iterates a predefined number of times."
