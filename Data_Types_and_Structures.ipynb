        "\n",
        "* Storage: The value is placed in the array at the calculated index. If multiple keys hash to the same index (a \"collision\"), various techniques like separate chaining (using linked lists at each index) or open addressing (probing for the next available slot) are used to handle them.\n",

        "* When used with a list, the in operator checks for the presence of a specific element within the list's values.\n",

        "* It performs a linear search, iterating through each element in the list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The time complexity for this operation is typically O(n) in the worst case, meaning it can take longer as the list grows.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The elements of a tuple cannot be modified directly after the tuple has been created. Tuples in Python are immutable data structures.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
