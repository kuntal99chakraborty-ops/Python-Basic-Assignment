        "\n",
        "Parameters → Variables defined inside the function definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments → Actual values you pass when calling the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "def keyword: Initiates the function definition.\n",
        "function_name: A unique identifier for the function, following Python's naming conventions (lowercase with underscores for multiple words).\n",

        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
        "Terminating Function Execution: When a return statement is encountered within a function, the function's execution immediately stops. Any code lines after the return statement within that function will not be executed. Control is then passed back to the point in the code where the function was called.\n",
        "Returning a Value to the Caller: The return statement allows a function to send a value (or multiple values packed into a tuple) back to the part of the code that invoked it. This returned value can then be stored in a variable, used in an expression, or passed as an argument to another function. If no value is explicitly specified with the return statement, or if the return statement is omitted entirely, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts for working with sequences of data.\n",
        "An iterable is any object that can be iterated over, meaning you can traverse its elements one by one. Common examples include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. An object is considered iterable if it implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator, or the __getitem__() method with sequential indices.\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and allows you to access elements one at a time. It maintains an internal state to keep track of the current position during iteration. An object is an iterator if it implements both the __iter__() method (which returns itself) and the __next__() method. The __next__() method returns the next item in the sequence and raises a StopIteration exception w\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special type of iterable that generate values on the fly, one at a time, rather than storing all values in memory. This makes them particularly efficient for working with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they consume less memory compared to lists or other data structures that store all elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Generators are Defined:\n",
        "Generators are primarily defined in two ways in Python: generator functions.\n",
        "A generator function is similar to a regular Python function, but instead of using the return keyword to return a value and terminate, it uses the yield keyword. When yield is encountered, the function's state is paused, and the yielded value is returned. The next time the generator is iterated upon, execution resumes from where it left off, maintaining its local variables and state.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators offer advantages over regular functions through memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, and the ability to represent infinite sequences. By using the yield keyword to produce values one at a time, generators avoid storing large datasets in memory, making them suitable for large or infinite data streams and enabling more efficient data processing pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Generators produce values on-demand using yield, rather than creating a complete list in memory. This is crucial for handling large datasets or infinite sequences, as it avoids high memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Values are computed only when requested, improving performance and reducing computational overhead when the entire dataset is not immediately needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite streams of data, like the Fibonacci sequence, because they don't need to store all elements at once. They produce the next value in the sequence as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions are typically single-expression functions and do not require a formal name.\n",
        "\n",
        "When is it typically used\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are particularly useful in situations where a small, simple function is needed for a short duration or as an argument to another function, often referred to as a higher-order function. Common use cases include:\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The map() function in Python serves to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and returns an iterator that yields the results. Its primary purpose is to transform data within a collection by uniformly applying a specified operation without the need for explicit loops, leading to more concise and often more efficient code.\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "The map() function takes at least two arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "function: The function to be applied to each item. This can be a built-in function (like int, str), a user-defined function, or an anonymous function created with lambda.\n",
        "\n",
        "iterable: One or more iterables whose elements will be passed as arguments to the function. If multiple iterables are provided, the function must accept a corresponding number of arguments, and map() will process elements from each iterable in parallel until the shortest iterable is exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python functions map(), filter(), and reduce() are all used for processing iterables but differ in their core purpose and output:\n",
        "map():\n",
        "Purpose: Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a new iterable (a map object in Python 3) containing the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: An iterable of the same length as the input, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding input element.\n",
        "Example: To square every number in a list.\n",

        "For reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [1,2,3,4]), the working is:\n",
        "The reduce function, often found in functional programming paradigms, iteratively applies a given function to the elements of a list, accumulating a single result. For a sum operation on the list [47, 11, 42, 13], the internal mechanism unfolds as follows:\n",
