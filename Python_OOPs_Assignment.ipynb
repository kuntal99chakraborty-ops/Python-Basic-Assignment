        "\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. Its like building with LEGO bricks—each object is a self-contained unit with its own data and behavior, and you can combine them to create complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that its objects will have—think of it as a recipe, and each object is a dish made from that recipe.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is the fundamental building block—its an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: Hiding implementation details and showing only essential functionalities.\n",
        "Purpose: To reduce complexity by providing a simplified view of a system or object.\n",
        "How it's achieved: Often through abstract classes and interfaces in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: Bundling data (properties) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, like a class.\n",
        "Purpose: To protect the internal data and methods from unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity and privacy.\n",
        "How it's achieved: By using access modifiers (like private) to restrict direct access to data, and providing public getter and setter methods for controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python identified by their names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __add__, __str__). The term \"dunder\" is an abbreviation for \"double underscore.\"\n",
        "These methods are not typically called directly by a programmer. Instead, they are invoked internally by Python in response to specific operations or events, allowing for customization of how objects behave with built-in functions and operators\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows a new class to derive properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class. This creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, promoting code reusability and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism in OOP is the concept that an object, method, or variable can take on many forms. It allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms or behaviors, making programs more flexible and adaptable by enabling you to handle objects of different types uniformly through a common interface. Key types include compile-time (static) polymorphism, achieved through method overloading, and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism, implemented via method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python, while not as strictly enforced as in some other object-oriented languages, is primarily achieved through a combination of conventions and features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes: The fundamental unit of encapsulation in Python is the class. Classes bundle data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single, cohesive unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Getters and Setters (Properties): To provide controlled access to internal data, especially private attributes, Python utilizes getter and setter methods. These methods allow you to add logic, validation, or other operations when accessing or modifying an attribute. The @property decorator offers a more Pythonic way to implement getters and setters, allowing you to access them like attributes while still benefiting from the underlying methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically invoked when a new object (instance) of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes and set up its initial state.\n",
        "The constructor in Python is defined using the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, both class methods and static methods are defined within a class but differ in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A class method is bound to the class and receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "* It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "* Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes, but not instance-level attributes directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A static method is a regular function that is logically grouped within a class but does not receive any implicit first argument (neither self for an instance nor cls for the class).\n",
        "* It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "* It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "Static methods do not have access to the class's state or instance's state. *They behave like standalone functions but are placed within a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python refers to the concept of having multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but can handle different numbers or types of arguments. While Python does not support traditional method overloading like some other languages (e.g., Java or C++), where you define multiple methods with the same name and distinct parameter lists, it offers alternative ways to achieve similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding in OOP allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class, a process that is also known as runtime polymorphism. Key requirements include inheritance>> (the subclass must inherit from the parent) and a matching method signature>> (same name, return type, and parameters). This enables the subclass to customize inherited behavior, with the version of the method executed depending on the actual object type at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, the @property decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods within a class to be accessed and managed like attributes. It provides a \"Pythonic\" way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for attributes, encapsulating the logic for accessing, modifying, or deleting an attribute without directly exposing the underlying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) due to its ability to enhance code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface or structure that its subclasses must adhere to, ensuring consistency and promoting good object-oriented design.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: Complex systems are broken down into smaller, self-contained objects and modules, making them easier to develop, test, and troubleshoot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows new classes to reuse code from existing ones, reducing redundancy and development time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to different objects, providing adaptable solutions and making code more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability: Modular design and encapsulation make it easier to update and maintain individual parts of a system without affecting unrelated components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: OOP's modular structure makes it easier to scale programs to handle increasing data or workload.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ownership: Belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class. They are declared within the class but outside of any methods and are often marked with a static keyword in languages like Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope: Shared among all instances of the class. All objects created from that class will access and potentially modify the same single copy of the class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access: Can be accessed directly using the class name (e.g., ClassName.variableName) or through an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases: Suitable for data that is common to all instances, such as constants, counters, or shared configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ownership: Belong to a specific instance (object) of the class. Each object has its own independent copy of the instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope: Local to each instance. Changes to an instance variable in one object do not affect the same variable in other objects of the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access: Must be accessed through an instance of the class (e.g., objectName.variableName).\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases: Ideal for storing data that is unique to each individual object, representing the state or characteristics of that specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to combine functionalities and characteristics from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special \"dunder\" (double underscore) methods that define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are intended for different audiences:\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__(self):\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Provides an \"informal\" or user-friendly string representation of an object. This representation is intended for human readability and understanding by the end-user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: It is implicitly called by functions like print(), str(), and when an object is used within an f-string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: To be readable and concise, focusing on the most relevant information for a user.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__(self)\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Provides a \"formal\" or unambiguous string representation of an object, primarily intended for developers and debugging. This representation should ideally be detailed enough to allow for the reconstruction of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: It is implicitly called by the repr() function, when an object is evaluated in the Python REPL (interactive shell), and as a fallback if __str__ is not defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal: To be unambiguous and explicit, often including enough information to recreate the object using eval().\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The super() function in Python holds significant importance within the context of object-oriented programming, particularly concerning inheritance. Its primary role is to provide a mechanism for accessing methods and attributes of a parent or sibling class from within a child class.\n",

        "Use Cases: Static methods are typically used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "Utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not depend on the class's state or any specific instance's data.\n",

        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python, when combined with inheritance, primarily functions through method overriding. This allows objects of different classes, related by inheritance, to be treated as instances of a common type while exhibiting specialized behavior through their overridden methods.\n",

        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be invoked as if it were a regular function. When an object of a class that defines __call__ is \"called\" using parentheses, like object_instance(arg1, arg2), the __call__ method of that object is automatically executed."
